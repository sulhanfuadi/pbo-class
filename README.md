# pbo-class

**A repository containing various code examples and assignments for Object-Oriented Programming (PBO). This repository is dedicated to exploring and implementing core OOP concepts through practical Java code.**

## üìö About This Project

The pbo-class repository is a collection of code examples and assignments focused on Object-Oriented Programming (PBO). The examples, originally developed as part of an assignment for a PBO course, demonstrate key concepts such as object creation, state manipulation, method invocation, and testing. Key classes include [`Titik.java`](PBO01%20Object%20Orientation/object_orientation/src/Titik.java) (representing a point) and [`Garis.java`](PBO01%20Object%20Orientation/object_orientation/src/Garis.java) (representing a line). Additional programs like [`App.java`](PBO01%20Object%20Orientation/object_orientation/src/App.java), [`MTitik.java`](PBO01%20Object%20Orientation/object_orientation/src/MTitik.java), [`MTitikRefactored.java`](PBO01%20Object%20Orientation/object_orientation/src/MTitikRefactored.java), and [`MGaris.java`](PBO01%20Object%20Orientation/object_orientation/src/MGaris.java) serve to demonstrate and test these concepts.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

To begin, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sulhanfuadi/pbo-class.git
cd pbo-class
```

<!-- ### Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **PBO01 Object Orientation/**
  This folder contains the course materials for Object Orientation, including:
  - **object_orientation/src/**: The source code files (.java)
    - Examples: `Titik.java`, `Garis.java`, `App.java`, etc.
  - **object_orientation/bin/**: The compiled output files (.class)
  - **object_orientation/lib/**: Dependencies (if any)
  - **object_orientation/.vscode/**: VS Code configuration files (e.g., `settings.json`) -->

Ensure that the paths in the VS Code settings are correctly configured for the Java compiler and output folder.

### Building and Running

1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
2. Verify that Java and the VS Code Java extension are installed.
3. Compile the source code by running the following command in the terminal:
   ```bash
   javac -d bin src/*.java
   ```
4. Run the main program, for example:
   ```bash
   java -cp bin App
   ```

## üìñ Topics Covered

1. **Titik (Point)**
   Demonstrates point manipulation methods such as shifting, reflection, and distance calculation.
   See: `Titik.java`

2. **Garis (Line)**
   Illustrates how to represent and operate on a line, including computations of length, gradient, midpoint, and checking for parallelism or perpendicularity.
   See: `Garis.java`

3. **Application and Testing**
   - The main demonstration of the program is found in `App.java`.
   - Point operations are tested in `MTitik.java` and `MTitikRefactored.java`.
   - Line functionalities are explored in `MGaris.java`. -->
